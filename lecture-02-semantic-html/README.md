# Lecture 02 – Semantic HTML & Structure

## 1. What I implemented this lecture
- Rebuilt my portfolio page using semantic HTML elements
- Structured the page with header, main content sections, and footer
- Added images, links, and an embedded video using semantic markup
- Applied basic accessibility features such as alt text and a skip link

## 2. Semantic decisions I made (REQUIRED)

### Decision 1
- Element(s) used: `<header>`
- Where in the page: At the top of the document
- Why this element is semantically correct:
  The header contains the main introduction of the page, including my name, role, and short personal information.

### Decision 2
- Element(s) used: `<section>`
- Where in the page: Portfolio section and Areas of Interest section
- Why this element is semantically correct:
  Each section groups related content under a clear heading, making the page structure logical and easy to understand.

### Decision 3
- Element(s) used: `<figure>` and `<figcaption>`
- Where in the page: Around images and the embedded video in the portfolio
- Why this element is semantically correct:
  These elements clearly associate visual media with descriptive captions, improving meaning and accessibility.

## 3. Accessibility considerations
- Added a skip link to allow keyboard users to jump directly to the main content
- Used alt text for all images
- Followed correct heading hierarchy (h1 → h2)
- Used semantic HTML elements instead of generic divs

These features improve usability for screen reader users and keyboard navigation.

## 4. What I learned
- How to use semantic HTML elements correctly
- Why page structure is important for accessibility
- How semantic markup improves readability and maintainability

---

## 5. What I still need to improve
- Writing more detailed and descriptive alt text
- Structuring larger and more complex pages semantically

## 6. Notes about AI usage (if any)
- Tool used: ChatGPT
- What I accepted as-is: General HTML structure and README template
- What I modified manually: Text content, personal information, and links
